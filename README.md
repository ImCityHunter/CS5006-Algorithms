# CS5006-Algorithms

Course Description: 
This course builds on the knowledge of algorithms that was gained in CS 5001, CS 5002, and CS5004 by formally studing several classes of algorithms that students implemented examples of in those earlier courses. It also looks at additional types of algorithms that are enabled by system features being studied at the same time in CS 5007, including concurrent algorithms enabled by the introduction of threads, and distributed algorithms enabled by interprocess communications and remote procedure calls.

This course is taught by Professor Phil Gust
